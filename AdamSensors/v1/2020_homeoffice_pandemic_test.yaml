# The AdamSensors CSC reads voltages off of the ADAM 6024's six analog input channels, in
# the range of -10v to 10v. This configuration file allows a type and coefficients to be
# specified for each channel, so that several types of sensors can be used with a single
# ADAM device. Types tell the CSC what units to use when publishing telemetry from that
# sensor. These are the available types and their associated units:
#
# Type:         Unit:
#
# Temperature   Degrees Celsius
# Pressure      Pascals
# None          N/A
#
# Coefficients define a polynomial expression that is used to convert volts to
# the appropriate units. These are passed as a sequence, in descending order. For example,
# [4, 2, -3] defines the polynomial 4x^2 + 2x - 3. For the TD-1000 pressure transducer used
# for development, the polynomial is 34478x.
