Configuration for AdamSensors CSC

The ADAM 6024 has 5 analog inputs. For each input, there is a configurable "type" field which accepts "Pressure", "Temperature", or "None" as possible values. These tell the CSC which units to use for whatever type of sensor is connected to that input. The CSC then reads the voltage off of each input, a value in the range of -10 to 10. Each input also has a configurable minimum and maximum value, which is used to perform a linear mapping from the voltage to whatever the range of possible values for the particular sensor/unit is. For example, for the TD1000 transducer used fo testing, 0v corresponds to 0 Pa, and +10V is 3447380 Pa. Remember that the minimum value corresponds to -10v, not 0v, so the correct way to  configure the TD1000 would be to set -3447380 as the minimum and 3447380 as the maximum. Since negative values are meaningless for pressure, the CSC should always report pressure telemetry in the range of 0-3447380 Pa.
